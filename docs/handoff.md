**As of:** 2026-08-20 · `main = df4365d` · **`v0.M10.0` tagged** · gh `AliSleiman0`.

## ⭐ Next session

**M10 is sealed. Nothing is in flight — zero open PRs — and the next decision is which milestone to
start.** The repo is at a clean stopping point for the first time in a week.

⚠️ **Verify this file before planning from it.** `gh pr list`, `gh issue list --state open`,
`git rev-parse --short origin/main` — three commands, always right. See the BATON-CAN-BE-WRONG entry
below; it has cost a whole planning cycle once already.

### Pick M9 or M11 — and they are not equivalent

- **M9 "It moves"** (epic #198, 10 open children, 5 IED). Motion: gesture vocabulary, `MotionService`,
  `look_at`, the affect→gesture map. **Not on the critical path** (PMP §5.4 goes M6 → M10 → M11), so
  it is the *optional* milestone. The hardware is already proven — two servos on a PCA9685, verified
  on the rig — and #204/#203 collide with `services/tools.py` and `main.py`, the same files M10 just
  finished editing.
- **M11 "It's a product"** (#12, 1 open issue, 13 IED). **The critical path.** A 30-day unattended
  soak, O5, the runbook, `v1.0.0`. ⚠️ It is also where **M10's unrun AC-0 comes due** — a 30-day soak
  subsumes "does it fire on the second morning" and would surface the one property the seal skipped.

**Recommendation: M11.** It is the critical path, and it retires M10's only recorded gap as a side
effect rather than as extra work. M9 is a genuine feature but it is a detour, and PMP §7.3 is explicit
that proactivity "survives on the clock alone".

### What M10's seal deliberately did NOT prove

**AC-0 — multiple unattended mornings — was not run.** An explicit owner decision on 2026-08-20 to
seal and move on, taken with the risk stated. Two consequences to carry forward:

- **AC-1 is staged, not spontaneous.** For id=15 the cooldown was cleared by hand and the booking
  armed. It proves the mechanism end to end; it does not prove the robot doing this by itself.
- **The second morning has never happened on the rig.** `0d3ba60` fixed *"a trigger fired once and
  never again"* in this very codebase — that is the bug class AC-0 exists to catch, and it now rests
  on `test_three_cycles_a_day_apart_cost_no_wall_clock_time` alone. **O3's 7/7 mornings is
  unmeasured.**

🎁 **The trigger is armed and running right now.** `next_fire_at` = 23:55 EEST daily, `ignore_streak`
0, `enabled` 1, nothing staged. **Reading the log on any morning after tonight costs one command and
retires most of AC-0's risk for free** — do that before M11's soak rather than instead of it:

```sh
ssh alisleiman0@<pi> 'sudo python3 -c "
import sqlite3,datetime
c=sqlite3.connect(\"/var/lib/robot/robot.db\")
for r in c.execute(\"select id,considered_at,outcome,reason,utterance,user_reaction from proactive_log order by id desc limit 5\"): print(r)"'
```

An id=16 that is `delivered` with a real utterance, on a night nobody touched the machine, is AC-0's
first morning — and worth appending to `docs/journal.md` even after the tag.

### The queue behind it

- **#328** — the P8 async-debug gate grades test bodies, not the robot's callbacks. Now **three
  false positives on three unrelated PRs with three different untouched tests** (`test_presence.py:229`
  0.083 s, `test_memory.py:216` 0.074 s, `test_memory.py:519` **0.052 s** — two milliseconds over).
  Its signal-to-noise on P8 is 0:3, so a real slow callback would now be indistinguishable from noise.
  Every red costs a merge-past-a-red-gate judgement call. **Fix it before it trains someone to ignore it.**
- **#310** — `set_affect` never fires. `tools/eval_extraction.py` needs repair first (beta header +
  stale model).
- **#267 / #265 / #264** — memory-quality defects from M7's gate, all still open.
- **#289** — `Pca9685Servo` shares the AVID-266 lazy-open shape; latent until M9 wires preemption.

## Current state

- **M10 sealed 2026-08-20 as `v0.M10.0`.** Epic #230, #245 and all 14 children closed; milestone
  closed. `docs/journal.md` and PMP §5.2 both carry the seal, **including what it did not prove**.
- **Zero open PRs.** `main = df4365d`.
- **The Pi is ON, running `df4365d`, service active and enabled.** `alisleiman0@172.20.10.6` over the
  iPhone hotspot (the address moves with the network). `/etc/robot/config.toml` gained
  `capture_stall_s = 5.0` (backup `.bak-pre-347`). Clock NTP-synced.
- ⚠️ **The machine's quiet window is `02:00→09:00`, NOT `config/pi.toml`'s `22:00→07:30`.** Deliberate
  and load-bearing: the routine is 00:00 decaf, which the shipped window would suppress every night.
  **Do not reconcile in either direction** — `tests/core/test_config.py:504` asserts the repo's
  window precisely *because* it crosses midnight, and `02:00→09:00` does not.
- ⚠️ **`facts` id=19 still reads "8 in the morning" while `routines` says `00:00`.** #346's fix makes
  the robot state the *schedule*, so the utterance is right either way — but the rows still disagree.
  Correcting it is a **voice** job, not SQL: a raw `UPDATE facts SET text` leaves an embedding for the
  old sentence and skews §7.7 retrieval silently.
- ⚠️ **`mypy` cannot run locally.** `numpy/__init__.pyi` — *"Type statement is only supported in
  Python 3.12 and greater"*. Pre-existing on clean `main`, verified by stashing; CI is unaffected. Do
  **not** "fix" it by re-syncing with `--extra memory` on 3.13 (numpy 1.26.4 has no cp313 wheel and
  builds from source, which fails). `uv sync --dev --frozen --python 3.13` then
  `uv pip install "numpy>=2.1"` restores a working env without touching `uv.lock`.

## What just shipped (2026-08-19 → 20)

Five PRs in one session, four of them fixes the rig found and CI could not:

- **#344** — CI cost cut. The numpy cap is now marker-conditional; it had been leaking into the
  `memory` extra, and 1.26.4 has no cp313 wheel, so `test (3.13)` and `async-debug` were **compiling
  numpy from source on every run** — 5m02s each, ~10 of the 13 billable minutes. `pull_request` was
  removed and then **restored at the owner's call**: the trigger was never where the minutes were.
- **#345** — the scheduler slept through a booking when the clock stepped. Every sleep is now bounded
  by `min(stale_grace_s, IDLE_SLEEP_S)`, and a step is logged. `FakeClock.step_wall_clock()` exists
  because the fake could not previously *state* the defect.
- **#346** — `behavior.trigger_fired` carries `occurrence_at`, so §10.8's block states the schedule
  rather than re-reading the hour out of prose. Also closed two untested holes in
  `memory.fact_superseded`: a soft-deleted fact orphaned its `routines` row, and a correction with no
  `schedule` silently deleted a working trigger.
- **#347** — `AudioService` gained a capture watchdog and two events; `BehaviorService` refuses to
  score an unanswered turn as an ignore when the mic was not delivering. `user_reaction` stays NULL —
  §8.3 already defines that as *"unknown yet"*, so no migration.
- **#343** — AC-2's evidence and the fixture that was blocking AC-1.

## Standing gotchas (carry forward)

### `uv sync` on the Pi is the same mistake as `uv run` — and it destroys the venv

`PI_OPERATIONS.md` §2 says *"Never `uv run` on the Pi"*. **`uv sync` is that trap wearing a different
name**, and it is worse: it decided the interpreter should be a downloaded CPython 3.13 instead of
system 3.11, deleted `.venv/bin`, and only then failed on permissions. The service kept running on
its already-loaded process, so **nothing looked broken until the next restart**.

Rebuild it the documented way, and note the two things easy to get wrong:

```sh
sudo rm -rf /opt/avid/.venv
sudo /usr/bin/python3 -m venv --system-site-packages /opt/avid/.venv   # 3.11, and system-site
cd /opt/avid && ~/.local/bin/uv export --frozen \
    --extra pi --extra memory --extra openai --no-hashes --no-emit-project -o /tmp/req.txt
sudo ~/.local/bin/uv pip install --python /opt/avid/.venv/bin/python -r /tmp/req.txt
sudo ~/.local/bin/uv pip install --python /opt/avid/.venv/bin/python -e . --no-deps
sudo /opt/avid/.venv/bin/python -c "import picamera2, numpy, websockets, openai, avid; print('ok')"
```

⚠️ **`--extra openai` is not optional and is easy to forget.** Leaving it out produces a stack that
boots, passes every health check, fires its trigger, transitions `IDLE → THINKING` — and then dies
in the bus handler with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'websockets'`. The robot goes through
every motion of speaking and makes no sound. That happened during the M10 seal.

⚠️ **`uv export --frozen` rather than a resolve.** It respects `uv.lock`, which is what keeps
`numpy==1.26.4 ; python_full_version < '3.12'` — the cap `picamera2` needs — instead of letting a
fresh resolution pick 2.x and break the camera for a reason that looks nothing like the cause.

### `vision.presence_gained` fires on ARRIVAL only — sitting still ages out

Rule 3 grades `presence_age_s` against a 300 s window, and the age is measured from the last
`vision.presence_gained`. That event is **edge-triggered**: a person who sits down and stays put
generates exactly one, and six minutes later the gate vetoes on `presence` while they are staring
straight into the camera.

Two ways to re-arm it before a staged fire, and the second is much more reliable:

1. Step **out** of frame long enough for the filter to lose you (~75 s at the shipped hysteresis),
   then walk back in. Fiddly to time against a fire you have already armed.
2. **Restart the service.** `PresenceService` starts cold and re-acquires within a few seconds, which
   stamps a fresh `presence_gained` with the person already sitting there. This is what finally landed
   AC-1 after two near-misses of 25 and 386 seconds.

⚠️ This is a *staging* aid, not a defect — for a real 07:55 morning the user is arriving anyway. But
every hand-staged proactive test will trip over it, and the failure looks exactly like "the camera
cannot see me".


- ⚠️ **The Pi has no RTC, so an offline boot comes up with a plausible, badly wrong clock — and
  nothing says so.** Found this session powered on and reading **`00:38 UTC` when the real time was
  `09:01`** — 8½ hours behind, resumed from `systemd-timesyncd`'s last saved stamp because the WiFi
  had drifted onto a router with no upstream. `timedatectl` said `System clock synchronized: no`
  while `NTP service: active`, which reads reassuring at a glance. **Every scheduler result is
  worthless at an unknown clock**: at the wrong time the stale booking sat 4 hours in the *future*
  and the boot would have proven nothing at all. Check `timedatectl | grep synchronized` **before**
  any run whose evidence is a timestamp, and re-check after any network change.

- ⚠️ **A suppression reason names the FIRST rule that vetoed, never the only one.** §10.4's six rules
  are ordered and short-circuit, so `reason='quiet_hours'` is equally consistent with "quiet was the
  only blocker" and with "quiet, presence, cooldown and budget would all have blocked it". A proof
  that quiet works therefore has to **rule the others out by construction** — this session aged
  `last_fired_at` past the cooldown and confirmed presence was gained inside `presence_window_s`
  before trusting the row. **Before claiming a criterion, ask which other rules were live**; the log
  will not tell you and it will not look wrong.

- ⚠️ **`reason='quiet_hours'` covers two different branches and cannot distinguish them.**
  `domain/behavior.py:257` checks the `set_quiet` override *first* and falls through to the static
  window: `if ctx.quiet_until is not None and ctx.now < ctx.quiet_until: return True` then
  `return within_quiet_window(...)`. Both log the same string. So a `set_quiet` test proves the
  **override** branch and says nothing about the **static window** — #245's AC-2 and AC-3 are
  genuinely different criteria that produce byte-identical audit rows. Grade them on separate runs.

- ⚠️ **"Assert the absence of the illegal-transition warning" no longer works on any arc involving
  vision.** `PresenceService._on_gained` calls `transition(VISION_PRESENCE_GAINED)` **unconditionally**
  (`services/presence.py:285`), by design: #224 rejected both a `if state is SLEEPING` guard (a second
  copy of the table) and six self-loop rows (each would publish a spurious `state.transitioned`).
  Only `(SLEEPING, …) → IDLE` exists, so a person sitting down at an awake robot logs
  `ignored illegal transition: no rule for VISION_PRESENCE_GAINED in state IDLE` at WARNING —
  measured **once per boot, five times in one afternoon, deterministic**. The decision is sound and
  the `test_m5_gate` absence-assertion is sound; they simply **conflict at this seam**. If you need
  that assertion on a vision-involving arc, filter this specific message rather than weakening either.

- ⚠️ **The LAN cable does carry traffic — `PI_OPERATIONS.md` §0 is out of date on this.** With WiFi
  on a dead network, the Pi was still reachable from the laptop over the direct Ethernet link:
  neither end gets DHCP, both fall back to link-local, and **mDNS resolves it** —
  `ssh alisleiman0@avid.local` worked, resolving to an IPv6 link-local (`fe80::…%<ifIndex>`), with
  `Get-NetNeighbor` confirming the Pi's `D8:3A:DD` MAC as `Reachable`. That is the out-of-band path
  that makes it *safe* to reconfigure `wlan0` remotely. ⚠️ It is also **intermittent** — it dropped
  after a few minutes and never returned — so treat it as a rescue channel, not a working link, and
  do the WiFi fix at the console if it lapses.

- ⚠️ **The state a fixture never enters is the state that breaks in production.** Every boot test in
  `tests/services/test_behavior.py` booked `_START + 60` — always in the *future* — so no test in the
  suite had ever asked what happens to a trigger whose moment passed while the robot was off. #339
  was invisible until the rig spent a night unplugged. This is the third instance in two sessions:
  a fixture with no audio chunk hid #338, and a single-fire assertion hid #337. **When writing a
  fixture, ask what was left out and why; if the answer is "another milestone owns that", it is the
  bug's hiding place.** The corollary for scheduled work: *one* occurrence proves a mechanism fires,
  never that it fires *again* — and the interesting states are the ones reached by time passing
  rather than by the test doing something.

- ⚠️ **Powering the rig off is not a neutral act — it is an input.** Three of the last four defects
  were only reachable through the boundary between the robot's clock and reality: a process restart
  (#337), a crash mid-turn (#338), an overnight power-off (#339). None was reachable by a suite that
  starts every scenario from a clean, running system. Treat *"what does this look like after a
  reboot, a crash, and a night off"* as a first-class question for anything that persists state.

- ⚠️ **A check that queries through the port can be structurally incapable of failing.** The M7
  gate's "no FTS5 entry outlives a deleted row" check first asked `FactRepository.keyword_search`,
  which **JOINs `facts`** to filter superseded rows — so it can only ever return ids that still have
  a live row, and an orphaned index entry is invisible to it. It passed a store where the delete
  trigger had been dropped. The honest question was behavioural (`SELECT rowid FROM facts_fts WHERE
  facts_fts MATCH ?`, then compare against live ids). **Before trusting a check, ask what result
  would make it fail** — and note `facts_fts` is **external-content** (`content='facts'`), so a
  plain `SELECT text` reads *through* to the deleted row and reports a leak as clean.
- ⚠️ **A gate harness cannot grade two mutually destructive states in one run.** M7's supersession
  and forget turns *destroy the evidence its recall criterion is scored on* — a correct robot scored
  **2/4**, reading exactly like a model that forgot half of what it was told. The fix is two phases
  (`--mode recall` before the mutation turns, `--mode mutations` after) and deliberately **no mode
  that grades both**. Caught by the harness's own baseline test, which is the argument for writing
  the baseline first.
- ⚠️ **Testing a dispatcher's parts is not testing the dispatcher.** Every M7 harness test called the
  criterion functions directly with an explicit phase, so collapsing the two phases back into one —
  the exact defect the design prevents — left **all sixteen tests green**. Only argparse's `choices`
  guarded it. If a module's behaviour depends on a mode/flag/route, **one test must drive the real
  entry point with real argv**, or the wiring is unproven.
- ⚠️ **P8 is violated by CPU monopoly, not only by an un-threaded call.** `LocalMiniLmEmbedder.embed`
  already hopped to a thread and still stalled the loop, because ONNX's default pool took 3.92 of 4
  cores and starved the loop thread (#168). Code review cannot see this; only a real run on real
  hardware can. Both ONNX adapters now cap their pools — **and the thread count does not generalise**
  (Silero 1, MiniLM 2; copying `vad.py`'s 1 costs 340 ms/embed). Guarded by
  `tests/adapters/test_onnx_session_options.py`.
- ⚠️ **Two sessions writing `docs/handoff.md` at once produce a baton that describes work as missing
  while it is being merged.** On 2026-08-02 a parallel session rewrote this file from a mid-flight
  snapshot: it called a merged branch "uncommitted, never run" and told the next session to close an
  issue whose on-device ACs were still owed. `git add -A` then swept the edit into an unrelated
  feature commit. **Commit the handoff on its own, and check `git status` before `git add -A`.**

- ⚠️ **`config/pi.toml` IN THE REPO CANNOT RUN THE ROBOT.** It still ships M1-vintage all-fake
  adapters (`microphone`/`speaker`/`vad` = `"fake"`, `realtime = "replay"`). Every HAL bring-up
  flipped `/etc/robot/config.toml` on the machine and never the committed template. I copied the
  repo file over the machine's this session and had to restore from a backup — ***the machine is
  not the repo* applies in BOTH directions**, and `PI_OPERATIONS.md` only warns about one. Verify
  with `load_config` after any config move, never by eye.
- ⚠️ **A barge-in margin is only valid at the noise floor it was measured at.**
  `barge_in_margin_db = 3.0` was calibrated against a −40 dBFS floor. That same evening the room
  rose ~20 dB (a bare mic recording read −17.7 dBFS RMS with **nobody speaking**) and the robot
  stopped detecting speech entirely — no session, no reply, no error, and nothing wrong in the
  code. **Suspect the room before the robot when it goes quiet**, and record the floor beside the
  margin in any evidence.
- ⚠️ **A "P95" over fewer than 20 samples is the maximum.** Nearest rank picks `ceil(0.95n)`, which
  is `n` for every `n < 20`. Grading it against a P95 budget is *stricter* than the criterion — a
  real P95 tolerates 1 in 20 above the line, a maximum tolerates none. Fix the label, never the
  threshold.
- ⚠️ **A blackhole route does not close a TCP connection.** The kernel reports the unreachable route
  as a *soft* error; TCP retransmits for minutes and resumes when the route returns. Any "survives a
  network drop" test built on `ip route add blackhole` tests nothing. Use
  `nft ... reject with tcp reset`, scoped by destination so SSH survives — **and verify the cut
  actually blocks** (`curl` during the window) before trusting a run built on it.
- ⚠️ **The issue's stated cause can be wrong, including one you wrote an hour earlier.** #182 was
  filed as "two responses overlap"; `tools/probe_overlap.py` asked the API and proved a second
  `response.create` is *always* rejected. The real cause was an async generator reading the socket
  at playback speed. **Ten minutes with a probe beats an afternoon of inference** — and the probes
  (`probe_overlap`, `probe_first_token`, `probe_barge_in_frames`) need no mic, no speaker and no
  human, so there is no excuse.
- ⚠️ **A single-turn test cannot catch a latch that sticks on turn two.** Every #171 test drove one
  turn, where the first turn arms correctly even with #186's bug present. **If state persists across
  turns, the assertion belongs on the second one.**
- ⚠️ **`git checkout -- <path>` after a neuter destroys the fix along with the neuter.** It happened
  again this session, on the same file, minutes after the commit. Re-apply from the Edit history, or
  neuter with an edit you can reverse by hand.

- ⚠️ **THE BATON CAN BE WRONG. VERIFY ISSUE STATE BEFORE PLANNING.** A whole planning cycle went
  into #125 on the strength of a memory file saying "M7 8/15, #125 next" — #125 had merged four days
  earlier and M7 was 13/15. `gh issue list --state open` is one command and is always right; this
  file and the memory batons are point-in-time snapshots that rot between sessions. Cheap check,
  expensive omission.
- ⚠️ **A state machine with one axis cannot describe two mouths in a room.** #158, #161 and #162 were
  the same defect three times: every row looked defensible alone and the *composition* dead-ended.
  #161's obvious `(SPEAKING, speech_ended) → SPEAKING` self-loop reads better than the THINKING hop
  that shipped, and leaves SPEAKING sticky so the next reply's `playback_started` has no row. #162's
  recovery landed in IDLE, where nothing in the turn that *caused* the recovery had a row. **Assert
  transition arcs as whole journeys, never as rows** — `tests/domain/test_state.py`'s `_walk`
  helper exists for exactly this, and would have caught all three.
- ⚠️ **Assert the ABSENCE of the illegal-transition warning, not just the presence of the right
  moves.** `StateManager` logs `"ignored illegal transition"` at WARNING on the `avid.state` logger;
  a `caplog` assertion that it never fires is the only check that catches the row you did not know
  was missing. `tests/e2e/test_m5_gate.py::test_m5_gate_the_recovery_turn_drives_a_whole_legal_arc`
  is the pattern. It has to live in **e2e**, because illegal transitions are only reachable when the
  real `AudioService` is driving the audio edges — the service-level rig publishes the events but
  drives no transitions at all.
- ⚠️ **An unreachable row is a lie in a normative table** — and "obviously symmetrical" is not
  evidence of reachability. #162's plan wanted DEGRADED to absorb all four `audio.*` triggers; two of
  them are driven *only* from a coroutine that is torn down before DEGRADED can be entered, so those
  rows could never fire. `tests/domain/test_state.py` states the rule explicitly. **Trace the actual
  driver of every trigger before adding its row**, and note that publishing an *event* and driving a
  *trigger* are different things: `interrupt()` does the first and not the second.
- ⚠️ **`uv run --frozen --exact mypy avid` UNINSTALLS numpy** — that is how it reproduces CI's
  extra-free lint env. Re-run `uv sync --frozen --extra memory` immediately after, or the M7 memory
  tests fail with `ModuleNotFoundError: numpy` and look exactly like a regression. Bit twice in one
  session, the second time producing a commit made on a red suite. Same trap on the 3.11 leg:
  `uv sync --frozen --python 3.11 --extra memory` before `uv run --frozen --python 3.11 pytest`.
- ⚠️ **Two ways to fake a regression proof, both silent.** `git stash push <path>` is a **no-op on a
  file with no uncommitted changes**, so the "proof" runs against the fix and passes. And
  `git checkout HEAD -- <path>` **destroys uncommitted work** — it cost a full re-do of a service
  change this session. **Commit first, then prove** by neutering the specific guard (e.g. make
  `_uplink_shut` return False) and confirming the tests fail on *assertions*, not on `TypeError`
  from a changed constructor. A red for the wrong reason is not a proof.
- ⚠️ **Replay fixtures order `user_transcript` BEFORE the first audio delta** — the opposite of the
  live API. So an e2e assertion on the *shape* of a state move passes pre- and post-fix; assert the
  **`Trigger`** instead. This is the concrete form of "replay CI is structurally incapable of
  catching live-only defects", and it nearly let #158's e2e test prove nothing.
- ⚠️ **Adding work inside a timed function eats other tests' margins.** Building the TLS context
  inside `open()` (#166) made an existing overlap test time the CA parse too, against a
  `delay + 50 ms` budget: green in isolation, flaky in the full 3.11 run. **Passing alone and
  flaking in the suite is a margin being eaten, not a race** — look for what got slower before
  reaching for the flake label.
- ⚠️ **Bash heredocs die on apostrophes in prose.** A `cat > file <<'EOF'` block containing "§6.3's"
  aborted with `unexpected EOF while looking for matching` and wrote nothing. For anything with
  quotes in it — commit messages excepted, they are fine — use the Write tool and splice, never a
  shell heredoc. **And PowerShell has no heredocs at all**: `uv run python - <<'EOF'` is a parse
  error there (`Missing file specification after redirection operator`). Two shells, two failure
  modes, same rule: write a file.
- ⚠️ **Extending a scripted fake mid-run must be relative to its read cursor, not appended.**
  `FakeVoiceActivityDetector` indexes its script by `calls`, which runs on past the end while it
  holds the last verdict — so a plain `extend` lands *behind* the cursor and is silently never
  reached. #162's e2e rig did exactly that: it passed on 3.13 (fewer frames consumed first) and hung
  on 3.11. **A leg-dependent hang is an index race, not a flake** — and it is why both legs are run.
- ⚠️ **The P8 async-debug gate has tests sitting marginally over its 50 ms bar, and they flake on
  BOTH platforms.** Two known, neither a code defect:
  - **Windows dev box:** `tests/contract/test_fact_repository.py::test_a_few_thousand_rows_stay_off_the_loop`
    (~55–69 ms) fails *every* local run. Verified pre-existing at a prior SHA in a clean worktree.
    **Do not claim a local run is "clean under PYTHONASYNCIODEBUG=1" — say CI is.**
  - **Linux CI:** `tests/e2e/test_m4_gate.py::test_a_mute_robot_fails_the_gate` (0.054 s) failed the
    `async-debug` leg on a **docs-only** commit and passed on `gh run rerun --failed`.
  Note the failure mode: pytest reports every test passed and the *session* fails, so the summary
  line looks green. **Diagnose by exit code, and read the "P8 async-debug gate FAILED" block, not
  the pass count.** If this starts costing reruns, the fix is to give those two tests headroom (or
  their own threshold) rather than to raise the bar for everything — but that is its own change with
  its own measurement, and nothing has filed it yet.
- ⚠️ **Use a worktree, not a stash, to decide whether a suite anomaly is yours.**
  `git worktree add <tmp> <sha>` → `uv run --frozen pytest <tmp> --rootdir <tmp> -p no:cacheprovider`
  → `git worktree remove <tmp> --force`. It settles a changed test count or a suspicious failure in
  under a minute, touches nothing in the working tree, and cannot silently no-op the way
  `git stash push <path>` does. Also: a test count that moves by more than the tests you wrote is
  usually a **parametrized** case derived from the thing you changed (`TRANSITION_CASES` is built from
  the table, so four new rows added four cases) — reconcile the number rather than shrugging at it.


- ⚠️ **An absence of events is not evidence of a fault — it is evidence of nothing.** Twice tonight a
  silent log was read as "the robot went deaf" when the true cause was elsewhere (once: the owner was
  reading a message instead of speaking; once: `client.open()` was still in flight, swallowing the
  audio). Both readings were wrong and one was asserted to the owner. **Instrument for the positive
  case before concluding from a negative**: the heartbeat in `m5_evidence/trace_turns.py` prints
  frames-read, VAD-verdicts and queue depth every second, so a live-but-quiet system is
  distinguishable from a dead one *without anyone speaking*.
- ⚠️ **Never start a timed bench run in the same breath as a long explanation.** The owner cannot see
  tool output while a command runs, so a 150 s timer spent reading a wall of text produces a silent
  trace and a wasted session — it happened twice. **Hand over the trigger instead**: put the command
  in a script on the Pi (`/tmp/run_trace.sh`) and let the owner run it with `!` when they are ready.
  Keep the message before it short.
- ⚠️ **Nested quotes do not survive PowerShell → ssh → bash.** A command with `"$(sudo grep …)"` inside
  single quotes works from the Bash tool and silently loses the inner quoting when the owner pastes it
  into PowerShell — the env var ends up empty and the failure looks like a missing API key. Put it in
  a shell script on the far side and pass only plain arguments.
- ⚠️ **`ssh …` and `uv run` both quietly rewrite `uv.lock`.** A bare `uv run` during this session
  re-locked and collapsed numpy to 1.26.4 (no cp313 wheels → the 3.13 leg breaks). Use
  `uv run --frozen` / `uv sync --frozen` **always**, and check `git status uv.lock` before committing.
- ⚠️ **A port's docstring can be right while its only real implementation is wrong.** `TurnSink.mic()`
  always said *"mirroring `Microphone.stream`"* and `FakeTurnSink` always yielded frames; `AudioService`
  yielded whole utterances for two milestones and the contract suite never noticed, because the real
  leg is **skipped** there (a stateful service, not a stateless adapter). P6 buys nothing on a port
  whose real leg does not run — check that the skip list is not hiding the thing you care about.
- ⚠️ **Two VADs in series are coupled even when the config pretends they aren't.** Streaming made
  `[gate] silence_hold_ms` load-bearing for `[ai.turn_detection] silence_duration_ms`: the mic stream
  stops at the local hold, so a shorter one starves the server and the turn never commits — a robot
  that listens and then never answers, silently. Asserted in `Config` now. Whenever a local timer
  decides how long a remote timer gets to observe, write the inequality down.
- ⚠️ **A network-gated adapter is UNVERIFIED DEBT, not tested code.** `OpenAIRealtimeClient` sat
  behind `OPENAI_API_KEY` + `AVID_LIVE` from #105 until the #106 bench, and its first live run
  found **four** defects in a row, each hiding the next. Budget a live smoke before any gate that
  depends on such an adapter — the fixtures *record* the frames these bugs suppress, so replay CI is
  structurally incapable of catching them.
- ⚠️ **Per-call latency says nothing about what a library does between calls.** M4 measured Silero
  at 0.43 ms/frame — true, and it still hid an ONNX thread pool spinning three of four cores. Build
  `InferenceSession` with `intra_op_num_threads=1`, `ORT_SEQUENTIAL`, and
  `add_session_config_entry("session.intra_op.allow_spinning", "0")`. The M7 MiniLM embedder builds
  its own session and needs the same treatment.
- ⚠️ **`uv sync --extra <name>` RE-LOCKS, exactly like bare `uv run`.** It collapsed numpy to 1.26.4
  mid-session (the known 3.13-breaking trap). Always `uv sync --frozen --extra memory`.
- ⚠️ **The user cannot see tool output while a command runs.** "Speak now" instructions inside a
  long-running SSH command arrive only after it finishes. Announce the protocol in a *message*
  first, then launch — and launch bench runs **detached** (`setsid nohup … &`), because SSH drops
  mid-run otherwise orphan or kill them.
- ⚠️ **`pkill -f <pattern>` matches your own SSH command string** and kills the session before it
  does anything. Bit twice this session. Kill by PID, or use a pattern that cannot appear in the
  command you are typing.
- ⚠️ **A latency histogram is only meaningful if the human waits for each reply.** Talking over the
  robot makes `AudioService` stamp playback with the *newest* utterance's `correlation_id`, so
  first-audio pairs against the wrong `speech_ended` — one run produced −740 ms and +6710 ms rows.
  Measure O1 with a strict wait-for-reply protocol and exercise barge-in in a **separate** run.

- ⚠️ **The Pi cannot `git fetch` — push to it from the laptop.** `/opt/avid`'s `origin` is HTTPS
  with no credentials (`could not read Username for 'https://github.com'`), and in a `&&` chain that
  failure **silently skips every later step**, so a "put the Pi back on `main`" one-liner can report
  nothing and change nothing. `git push ssh://alisleiman0@192.168.10.172/opt/avid <branch>
  --follow-tags`, then check out on the far side and confirm with `git rev-parse --short HEAD`.
  Full note in `PI_OPERATIONS.md` §0.
- 📕 **All Pi/hardware traps now live in [`deploy/PI_OPERATIONS.md`](../deploy/PI_OPERATIONS.md)** —
  service-must-be-stopped, venv rules (no `pip`, never `uv run`, numpy `<2`, the dev group),
  config/unit drift, live framebuffer streaming, ALSA, the `pkill`-kills-its-own-SSH-session trap,
  and reading gate results honestly. Read it before touching the Pi.
- ⚠️ **A gate AC written before the design settled may be unsatisfiable — settle the wording on the
  issue *before* the run.** Four instances so far: M2's "full contract suite, none skipped"
  (impossible once the network-gated M5/M7 legs landed; `-m hardware` carries the claim now), M4's
  "≤200 ms mouth-to-ear" (impossible with `silence_hold_ms = 500` on a turn-based echo), M4 AC-5's
  **"SDS §5.4", a section that does not exist** (numbering shifted after the AC was drafted; §6.3 is
  what the criterion is about), and `docs/demos/README.md` asserting a `v0.M4.0` tag that never
  existed. M6 added a fifth of its own kind: **AC-5 asked for a "token budget" that cannot be
  measured without OpenAI's tokenizer**, which is not a dependency — it ships as a *character*
  ceiling, named as one. **The remaining gate issues are M9's, M10's (#245) and M11's; read their
  ACs for the same optimism before running them, and settle any renegotiation on the issue first.**
- ⚠️ **A gate that measures the *event* path can pass while the hardware does nothing.** The M4
  harness printed `PASS` over a mute robot because it timed `playback_started − speech_ended` and
  took `played_ms` from arithmetic over the submitted buffer. **Any "did it work" number must come
  from the device, not from what we handed the device.** When a check cannot apply (a fake adapter),
  say so **loudly in the output** — a silently disarmed check is indistinguishable from a passing
  one. Apply this reading to #106's O1 histogram and cost meter.
- ⚠️ **`0` from an instrument that recorded nothing reads exactly like a real `0`.** M6's dominant
  defect family — four separate harness bugs where *the report described something other than the
  run*: a banner quoting a config key the session had switched off, a harness keeping every number
  *about* the conversation and none of the conversation, a `set_affect` count of zero printed by a
  counter nothing incremented, and English transcribed as Korean (no `language` hint on
  `whisper-1`) feeding §7.6 for a whole milestone. **Derive every reported line from the run**, never
  from config or intent; print the instrument's own liveness beside any count that can legitimately
  be zero; keep the artefact, not only the statistic; and print every criterion **above** the verdict
  block — twice a real count was computed and then lost behind an early return.
- ⚠️ **A silent capture is diagnosed by counting non-zero samples, not by reading the mixer.** The
  Logitech H540's boom mute is a **hardware** switch ALSA cannot see: `amixer` reports `Mic … 89%
  [on]` while `arecord` returns frames of *exact zero*. Cost ~30 min this session chasing a
  playback defect that did not exist.
- ⚠️ **Never run bare `uv run` — it silently re-locks `uv.lock`.** It collapsed numpy mid-session,
  which is exactly the known 3.13-breaking trap. Pass **`--frozen`** to every `uv run`; check
  `git status uv.lock` before committing. (On the Pi the rule is stricter still: never `uv run` at
  all — see `PI_OPERATIONS.md` §2.)
- ⚠️ **`mypy avid` aborts inside numpy's stubs locally** ("Type statement is only supported in
  Python 3.12 and greater") whenever the `memory` extra is installed, because the 3.11 target meets
  numpy's 3.12-syntax stubs. CI's `lint` job never installs that extra, so it is green. Reproduce CI
  exactly with **`uv run --frozen --exact mypy avid`**.
- ⚠️ **Frame-level scoring against hand-drawn labels is boundary-noise dominated.** On short spans
  the disagreement is dominated by ±1–2 frames of boundary error, not by detector quality — 134
  spans produced ~15 s of spurious "missed speech" *and* ~14 s of spurious false opens. Measure each
  half where its ground truth is unambiguous (false-open on material with **no** speech at all;
  detection at the utterance boundary the system itself defines via `[gate] silence_hold_ms`), and
  never let a detector label its own test. Label the speech-**energy** region, never the clip
  extent.
- ⚠️ **Board project number ≠ node-ID intuition.** "Pico — Avid" is `gh project` **2**
  (`PVT_kwHOBcHqys4Bdmkk`); project **1** is an unrelated untitled scratch board. `gh project
  item-add` takes the **number** — use `2`. Added 16 M7 items to `1` by mistake this session and had
  to move them. Status field `PVTSSF_lAHOBcHqys4BdmkkzhYG9VM`; options `Backlog=8c0884d4`
  `Ready=a0c1d59b` `Done=c9ce2b3d` ([[avid-project-board-ids]]).
- ⚠️ **Two PRs that both edit the same exact-set assertion collide.** `tests/test_main.py` pins the
  exact **subscription set** (`_EXPECTED_SUBSCRIPTIONS` + `set(bus._subs)`), the **services list**
  (`[type(s) …]`), and the **health map**. Any two M7 PRs touching the same one collide — merge one, then
  `git merge origin/main` into the next and **union-resolve**. Bit #104/#105. (#122 edited the services
  list + health map, *not* the subscription set — MemoryService subscribes to nothing. **#124 touched
  none of them.** ✅ **RESOLVED: #125 turned out not to touch the subscription set either** — tool
  dispatch rides the Realtime pump rather than the bus, so it added no subscription. Two successive
  batons predicted that collision and both were wrong; nothing in M7 ever edited it.)
- ⚠️ **A service may not import an adapter (P1 `layers`: `adapters` sits *above* `services`).** So a
  service that needs an adapter's behaviour depends on a **Protocol** in `core/ports.py`, and `main`
  (the composition root, which *may* import adapters) injects the concrete. This is why #122 had to
  **promote `HybridRetriever` to a `Retriever` port** (#120's "portless, held concretely by #122" note
  was wrong — #122 is a service, not `main`). Rule of thumb: the moment application code needs to name
  an adapter, that's a new port, not an import. A pure encoder both layers share (e.g. `pack_embedding`,
  the §8.2 packer) belongs in `core`, not the adapter — that's why it now lives in `core/embedding.py`.
- ⚠️ **The vendor transport is a live-only path.** `OpenAIRealtimeClient` + `--capture` are
  network-gated (`OPENAI_API_KEY` + `AVID_LIVE`), never run in CI; only `_translate` + the capture
  round-trip are proven offline. Verify at #106.
- ⚠️ **`OPENAI_API_KEY` is unwrapped exactly once**, in `main._build_realtime`, only to build the
  auth header. Never log it, never a config file, never a `repr` (P7 / SECURITY.md).
- ⚠️ **CI `lint` runs ruff over the WHOLE repo** (`ruff check .` / `ruff format --check .`). Any file
  outside `avid/`+`tests/` (`tools/`, `docs/**/*.py`, `assets/**`) must be ruff-clean **and**
  formatted or lint fails even when `avid tests` is green.
- ⚠️ **ruff ASYNC109** — don't name an async param `timeout` (use `timeout_s` + `asyncio.timeout()`).
  **ASYNC110** — don't `while cond: await asyncio.sleep(...)` in a test; use an `asyncio.Event`.
- ⚠️ **`FakeMicrophone`'s default tone synth is real CPU** and under coverage tracing trips the P8
  >50 ms slow-callback gate at construction. Pass explicit `pcm=…` in AudioService-style tests.
- ⚠️ **The bus is FIFO per-subscriber, NOT across subscribers** (#72). Assert per-type counts, not
  cross-type arrival order. Every multi-subscription service inherits this.
- ⚠️ **Two timestamp conventions — do not cross-import** (M7). The `Event` envelope is epoch
  **milliseconds** (`timestamp_ms`); the memory store (`Fact`, §8.2/§8.3) is epoch **seconds**. A
  `Fact.created_at` is not a `timestamp_ms`. Scoring takes `age_days` (Δt injected by the caller from
  its own clock) — the domain reads no clock.
- ⚠️ **`0.5 ** float` types as `Any` under mypy --strict** (typeshed's `float.__pow__` overload
  widens). A `float(...)` wrap on the return pins it — cheaper and honester than a `# type: ignore`
  (see `recency_decay` in `avid/domain/memory.py`).
- ⚠️ **`tests/e2e/test_boot.py` flakes on cold CI runners** (15 s IDLE timeout); `skipif-win32`.
  `gh run rerun --failed` clears it — not a regression.
- ⚠️ **Affect tour order is load-bearing: IDLE must be LAST** (AffectService boots `current = IDLE`,
  suppresses a no-op blend → an IDLE-first tour renders 7 faces, not 8).
- ⚠️ **`FakeClock.advance` is async** — `await` it or it silently no-ops with a `RuntimeWarning`.
- ⚠️ **The `@'…'@` here-string is PowerShell.** In the POSIX Bash tool it's literal and makes the
  commit subject a bare `@`. Use `git commit -F -` with a heredoc for multi-line messages.
- **The ACs cannot see a bad face / hear a bad clip** (#70/#72). Eyeball rendered PNGs and listen to
  WAVs; byte-inequality is a floor, not proof.

## Working discipline

- **Never** write `close`/`fixes`/`resolves` + `#N` in a commit or PR body, even negated — the
  linkifier ignores the negation and auto-closes (it closed #57 once). Use `Refs #N`/prose; close by
  hand after merge. (This is why the four gate issues reference deps in prose.)
- **Ritual per issue:** branch off `main` → board Backlog→In Progress on branch create → PR
  (`Refs #N`) → board In Review → tick ACs → squash-merge + delete branch → close issue by hand →
  board→Done → sync `main` → re-verify green. (`gh pr merge --squash` may be classifier-blocked in
  auto-mode → the user runs `!gh pr merge <n> --squash`.)
- **Gate/seal ritual:** on the Pi, run the demo → paste numbers into `docs/demos/README.md` →
  commit the permanent CI e2e proof → **annotated tag `v0.MX.0` on the merge commit** → close the
  milestone + epic + all children by hand → board all → Done → journal line.
- **Every change:** `ruff` + `mypy --strict` on touched modules; `lint-imports`; ≥ 90% coverage on
  non-adapter code; tests on **both 3.11 and 3.13**; clean under `PYTHONASYNCIODEBUG=1`; SDS updated
  if an interface/event/schema changed. The 3.11 leg swaps `.venv`
  (`uv run --python 3.11 pytest`) — restore with `uv sync`, confirm `python -V` = 3.13.
- **`docs/handoff.md` is normally updated on its own, not inside a feature PR's diff.**
- **Settle contested AC wordings BEFORE the run, on the issue, in writing.** M5 did this for AC-4
  and it is the only reason the amended O1 ceiling reads as a decision rather than a rationalisation.
  A criterion renegotiated *after* seeing the number it failed is not a criterion.
- Board IDs, dev-env commands, and deeper per-issue detail live in the memory batons
  ([[avid-next-session-handoff]], [[avid-issue-tracker-state]], [[avid-project-board-ids]]).
